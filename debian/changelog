vlan (2.0.5ubuntu1) groovy; urgency=medium

  * Merge with Debian unstable (LP: #1883788). Remaining changes:
    - Conditionally defer udev-triggered vlan interface creation
      to after raw-interface-device ifup is complete
      From: Ubuntu bug 1701023
      Files changed:
      - debian/vlan.udev
      - debian/network/if-up.d/vlan
    - Add a udeb for vconfig in debian-installer
      From: Ubuntu bug 530468
      Note: This should be droppable as d-i should not require
      'vconfig' because it can use 'ip' to create vlans,
      but currently it still depends on vlan-udeb
      Files changed:
      - debian/control
      - debian/vlan-udeb.install
    - Add support for biosdevname
      Only small change still required

vlan (1.9-3.3ubuntu1) cosmic; urgency=low

  * Merge from Debian unstable.  Remaining changes:
    - In vlan ifupdown pre-up script, instead of calling ip link up for
      raw device before creating vlan interface, do a full ifup for raw
      device.  Otherwise, if raw device processes ifup after vlan device,
      the raw device may be taken down and back up, which removes all vlan
      routes and other configuration.
    - Correct previous patch, to work for ifupdown configuration where a
      vlan is configured but the vlan's raw device has no ifupdown config.
    - Revert change for lp1573272; instead fix by redesigning when vlan
      interfaces are created; after raw-device ifup, not during raw-device
      udev processing.
    - Add a udeb for vconfig in debian-installer.
    - Add udev hook and script for event based bring up.
    - Add support for biosdevname
    - Revert ifupdown integration as event based bringup is currently
      incompatible with the way ifupdown sets up bridges and vlans.

vlan (1.9-3.3) unstable; urgency=medium

  [ Stéphane Graber ]
  * Now that a vlan interface can be created by a udev hook and
    ifupdown checks return codes from the scripts,
    make sure to properly deal with an already existing interface.

  [ Dan Streetman ]
  * If VLAN is configured with higher MTU than raw device MTU, which can
    happen if VLAN is ifup'ed before raw device, then increase raw device
    MTU first so the VLAN ifup does not fail. (LP: #1224007)

vlan (1.9-3ubuntu8) quantal; urgency=low

  * Revert last chance as udev doesn't accept that syntax.
  * Upon closer review of the scripts in the vlan package, I don't actually
    believe that the race/deadlock situation found in bridge-utils applies to
    vlan as it never waits for an interface to show up or call a script that
    would.

vlan (1.9-3ubuntu4) precise; urgency=low

  * Add a udev trigger similar to bridge-utils' so vlan interfaces are
    created when the parent appears (this will then trigger upstart and

  * Rewrite copyright file completely; some copyrights and licensing headers

  * Drop Debian specific exit codes for vconfig errors; use upstream exit
    codes instead; document this change in NEWS.
  * Big cleanup to build and rules; misc fixes for obsolete constructions.

      binaries, so simply rely on the upstream build.
    - Build with -O2 unless DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS has noopt.
  * Prepare to ship macvlan_config in the future.
  * Add support for bonding in if-pre-up and if-post-down scripts; cleanup
    these scripts; closes: #404630.

  * Add debian/TODO list.
  * Pass STRIP=true to the upstream build to avoid stripping; closes: #438253.
  * Hide "bind-type" in help string as it doesn't seem to be implemented;
    closes: #398807.
